Battleship Visualizer

This program was written for BCA Computer Team (09-10)'s first annual game tournament. It runs two or more Battleship AIs in a round-robin tournament and outputs total number of matches won and hit accuracy for each contestant. 

USAGE: The programs array declaration contains the program commands to execute. Each entry should be how you normally would run the program in the command line.

Here is a list of program types and how each entry should be written, assuming all dependencies are installed:

- Windows executable (windows)
	"test.exe"
- class (windows, mac, linux)
	"java test"
- UNIX executable (mac, linux)
	"./test"
- Python script (windows, mac, linux)
	"python test.py"
- Ruby script (windows, mac, linux) [untested]
	"ruby test.rb"

For Python and Ruby files, enable execution on the script file and then it can be run like a UNIX executable.
